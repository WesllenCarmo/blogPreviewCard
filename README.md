The project is a single-page application featuring a centered blog preview card.
    
This project is a challenge from the Frontend Mentor website, a platform where developers can practice and improve their skills by building web applications based on provided designs. Although the project was originally intended to be built using HTML5 and CSS3, I chose to implement it using React in order to further develop my React.js skills. <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01IcS">Click here</a> to access the challenge page.
